# Corvo
_Corvo_ is a free and open-source tool that takes the visualization and analysis of [CZI CellxGene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) single-cell datasets to 3D Virtual Reality. Similar to CellxGene, Corvo takes a no-code approach for the end user, but also offers multimodal user input to facilitate fast navigation and analysis, and is interoperable with the existing Python data science ecosystem

You can launch Corvo by either running ```corvolauncher/gui/qt_main_window.py```, or by launching the accompanying app that is installed when you run ```setup.py```. 

Corvo is currently on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00519). Please cite this preprint in case you are using Corvo.

## Requirements

* A SteamVR-supported VR headset (e.g. Oculus Quest 2, HTC Vive) - Corvo not work without a VR headset at the moment.
* A computer equipped with a Geforce GTX 1050-class GPU at minimum, and 8 GB RAM.

## Installation
The following instructions use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), but you are welcome to use an alternative, like miniconda or mamba.

* Clone repository, recursive cloning here is important, as this will also clone the [corvo-core](https://github.com/scenerygraphics/corvo-core) submodule.
  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/scenerygraphics/corvo
  ```
* Import the provided `environment.yml` file for conda. This will install the required dependencies and create a new environment named `corvo`.
  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate corvo
  ```
* Run the provided setup script. This will compile `corvo-core`, and use setuptools to install corvo.
  ```
  ./build.sh
  ```
* Finally, you can run Corvo, by issueing `corvo` on the command line. Enjoy üëç
